## Adding Questions
To add new quiz questions, modify the questions file (`quiz_questions.txt`) following this format:

- Each question starts with `MC` (for multiple-choice).
- The next line is the question text.
- Then, specify the number of answer options.
- List the answer options, one per line.
- Finally, specify the correct answer's index (1-based).
- Use `---` as a separator between questions.
  
Example:
<p>MC
Which of the following is NOT a pillar of Object-Oriented Programming? <br>
4 <br>
Encapsulation <br>
Inheritance <br>
Compilation <br>
Polymorphism <br>
3 <br>

## Future Improvements
- More question categories (like True/False)
- Dynamic selection of number of questions
